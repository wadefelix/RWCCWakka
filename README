Wakka

A Wiki-esque website toolkit by Hendrik Mans.

Not much to read here. For some quick installation instructions, please
check out INSTALL.

Most of the Wakka documentation is available online only. Please visit
the official Wakka homepage at <http://www.wakkawiki.com>. You'll
find everything else there. (Eventually. :b)
