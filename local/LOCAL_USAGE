The local/ subdirectory is a good place to put your local CooCooWakka site scripts.
It's better to put your customizations and modifications here than to directly edit the files in the scripts/subdirectory, so that CooCooWakka updates won't accidentally overwrite your modifications.

You can create following directories and CooCooWakka will try to use those files in them first:
local/actions/
local/handlers/
local/libs/
local/language/

local/badwords.conf
local/interwiki.conf
